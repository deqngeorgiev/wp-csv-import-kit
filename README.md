## About

This repo contains boilerplate code to be used as starting point for importing CSV files in WordPress projects. 

Developers are expected to use the code via: 

`composer create-project htmlburger/wp-csv-import-kit csv-import`

This will create a directory csv-import and provide load file that should be included in the theme's functions.php code(or plugin load file).
